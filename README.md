`teal.reporter` empowers both `shiny` and `teal` applications to seamlessly integrate reporting functionality. Developers, whether working on a `shiny` app or a `teal` module, define the report's content, while `teal.reporter` takes care of the rest.

This package provides:

* A `shiny` module for adding cards (i.e. items) into a report
* A `shiny` module for previewing the report on-screen
* The ability to download a zip file containing the reports

## Installation

```r
# stable versions
install.packages('teal.reporter')

# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("insightsengineering/teal.reporter@*release")
```

Alternatively, you might want to use the development version available on [r-universe](https://r-universe.dev/).

```r
# beta versions
install.packages('teal.reporter', repos = c('https://pharmaverse.r-universe.dev', getOption('repos')))

# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("insightsengineering/teal.reporter")
```
