## Before and After Comparison

### Original Issue (from Screenshot)
The reported bug showed this problematic YAML header:

```
Report
NEST  
20279        ← ❌ Date shows as numeric instead of "2024-08-21"
true         ← ❌ Boolean shows as "true" instead of "yes"

Unnamed Card (1)
```

### After Our Fix
With our fixes applied, the YAML header now correctly shows:

```
---
author: NEST
date: '2024-08-21'    ← ✅ Proper date string format
title: Report
output:
  html_document:
    toc: yes          ← ✅ Proper YAML boolean format
---
```

## Technical Summary

**Problem**: Date objects and logical values were not being properly formatted for YAML serialization.

**Solution**: 
1. Added a safety net to convert any remaining Date objects to character strings
2. Enhanced logical value handling to process both direct logical inputs and character representations

**Impact**: 
- ✅ Dates now display as readable strings (e.g., "2024-08-21") instead of cryptic numbers
- ✅ Boolean values now use proper YAML format ("yes"/"no") instead of programming literals
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Fixes apply to all download formats (HTML, PDF, Word, PowerPoint)

The fix is minimal, targeted, and backward-compatible, addressing exactly the issues shown in the bug report.
