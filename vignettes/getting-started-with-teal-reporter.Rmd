## Introduction
While engaging with data analysis within a `shiny` app,
users often encounter insights that they wish to capture and share, be it through presentations, `markdown` articles, or other formats.
The `teal.reporter` package simplifies the process for both developers and end-users of `shiny` applications.
It allows for easy generation and dissemination of findings.
This eliminates the need for manual copy-pasting or writing in markdown.

`teal.reporter` provides a suite of modules and objects that integrate seamlessly to create reports directly from `shiny` apps with minimal effort for users and developers.

## Integration with `teal`
Discover how teal.reporter complements the [`teal`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal/) framework by visiting the dedicated [on integrating reporting in `teal`.](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal/latest-tag/articles/adding-support-for-reporting.html).

## Automatic Report Functionality
When working with `teal` modules, you can enable automatic report functionality by returning a reactive `teal_report` object from your module's server function. This triggers `teal` to automatically provide an "Add to Report" button, allowing users to seamlessly add module outputs to reports without any additional setup.

For more details on working with `teal_report` objects and their capabilities, see the [teal_report class vignette](./teal-report-class.html).

### More control
Developers who want more control over the reporting process and customization of the layout can benefit from learning about  topics such as `add_card_button`,`download_report_button` and `reset_report_button` offered by `teal.reporter`.
