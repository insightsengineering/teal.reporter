## Introduction

The `teal_report` class in `teal.reporter` provides a way to create reproducible reports step by step by adding markdown content alongside code evaluation.

The `teal_report` class is built on top of [`teal_data`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.data/latest-tag/articles/teal-data.html), inheriting all its reproducibility and code-tracking capabilities while adding reporting-specific functionality through `teal_card`.

This vignette shows you how to use `teal_report` to enhance your teal modules with reporting capabilities.


## Creating a teal_report

A `teal_report` is an object where developers can add, edit and remove various content (markdown content, plots, tables), evaluate and add code chunks within its environment. It provides a framework for building reproducible reports by combining content management with automatic code tracking.

To ensure complete reproducibility, it's recommended to start with an empty `teal_report` and build up your data and analysis using `eval_code()`:

```{r basic-usage}
library(teal.reporter)
report <- teal_report()
```

## Adding content to the `teal_report`

### Adding arbitrary markdown content

`teal_report` object allows one to compose a reproducible document containing markdown components. Use `teal_card(report)` to access and change elements of the document.
To add a new element in the `teal_card` one can use `c` method.

```{r}
teal_card(report) <- c(
  teal_card(report),
  "## Document section",
  "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet"
)

teal_card(report)
```

### Adding reproducible code chunks

`teal_report` inherits all methods from `teal.data`. Class utilizes `within()` and `teal.code::eval_code()` which execute arbitrary code in its environment but also add a code chunk to the reproducible document.

```{r}
report <- within(report, {
  a <- 2
})
report$a
teal_card(report)
```

In case when code generates an output one should specify which objects should be displayed below code chunk element. In the example below `head_of_iris` terminates a code chunk so adding `keep_output = "head_of_iris"` is needed to include it in the rendered document.

```{r}
report <- within(report,
  {
    head_of_iris <- head(iris)
    head_of_iris
  },
  keep_output = "head_of_iris"
)

teal_card(report)
```

## Modify `teal_report` content

`teal_report` allows to modify its content. Depending on the needs one can add, remove and replace element in the same way as one modifies a list (because `teal_card` is a `list`)

```{r}
# adding element in the beginnning of the document
teal_card(report) <- append(teal_card(report), "# My report", after = 0)

# removing code_chunk(s)
teal_card(report) <- Filter(
  function(x) !inherits(x, "code_chunk"),
  teal_card(report)
)

# replace an element
teal_card(report)[[1]] <- "# My report (replaced)"

teal_card(report)
```


## Output teal_report

`teal_report` supports several output formats. Currently it is possible to render `.Rmd`, `.md`, `.pptx`, `.doc`, `.pdf` and `.html`.

```{r}
# todo: we only export toHTML for now
#       it is not possible to generate other formats without passing to Reporter and using a shiny module
#       Do we need function like `export(output_format)` or `to_pdf`, `to_md`, `to_pptx`, `to_doc`
toHTML()
```

## Key Benefits

Using `teal_report` in your modules provides several advantages:

1. **Reproducibility**: All code is automatically captured via the underlying `teal_data` infrastructure
2. **Consistency**: Standardized way to create reports across modules  
3. **Flexibility**: Easy to add different types of content to reports
4. **Integration**: Works seamlessly with the teal reporter infrastructure
5. **Code Tracking**: Inherited `eval_code()` functionality ensures all computations are reproducible
