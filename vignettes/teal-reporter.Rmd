## Introduction
There are times when you explore data in your `shiny` module, spot an interesting finding and capture it, be it in
your slides presentation, a `markdown` article or another medium. `teal.reporter` helps you enhance a `shiny` module
so its users do not have to copy-paste and save every finding or write their own `markdown` to show it.

`teal.reporter` gives you ready to use `shiny` modules and objects that work together to prepare reports from
your module with minimal input from users of the `shiny` modules and from you as its developer.

And it can be done as easy as adding one of the reporting tools to your module:

```{r}
library(teal.reporter)
ui <- shiny::fluidPage(simple_reporter_ui("simple"))
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  # The bulk of your module logic here

  create_module_card <- function(card) {
    card$append_text("This is the content of the report from the `simple` module")
  }
  simple_reporter_srv("simple", Reporter$new(), create_module_card)
}

if (interactive()) shiny::shinyApp(ui, server)
```

## Where to next
### Basic usage
For the basic usage of `teal.reporter` and the quickest way to enhance your modules with reporting, head to
[the vignette about the simple reporting setup](./simpleReporter.html).

### Previewing a report
If you want to let the users of your application preview a report and reorganize it, look into
[the vignette on a "report previewer" module](./previewerReporter.html).

### Integration with `teal`
If you are interested in how `teal.reporter` fits into [`teal`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal/), look for
[a vignette about it in `teal`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal/latest-tag/articles/adding-support-for-reporting.html).

### More control
If you would like more control over the layout of a simple reporting tool, we recommend reading through the documentation
of the smallest building blocks `teal.reporter` offers, such as `add_card_button_srv()`, `download_report_button_srv()`
and `reset_report_button_srv()`.
