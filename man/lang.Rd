\description{
Sets or retrieves the language attribute of an element in a \code{teal_card}.
}
\details{
While primarily used to specify the language for code chunks (see \code{\link[knitr:knit_engines]{knitr::knit_engines}}),
\code{lang} can also be used to associate any element in a \code{teal_card} with a specific language.
This provides a mechanism to tie non-code elements (such as text sections or headings) to
code chunks. For example, when reports are rendered with "Include R code" unchecked,
all code chunks with \code{lang = "R"} are removed, and any other elements sharing the same
\code{lang} attribute are also removed from the report.
